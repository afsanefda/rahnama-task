## Client side

It's a create-react-app base project. For running it:

`yarn start` 
* navigate to localhost:3000



* to run tests
`yarn run test` 

## Back end side
This app  uses json-server to serve data. It uses faker.js to generate mock up data. For running it:

`yarn start` 
* runs on port 8000

## Images
I used https://unsplash.com/ for images so make sure you are connected to the network.

## UI-kit
I used antd in this case.

## Todos
* use a small db like lowdb compatible with json-server to add and remove comments
* it needs flow checks and more test coverage 
* it is needed to move all text in localization file
